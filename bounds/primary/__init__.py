Bounds on the primary problem.

The secondary problem is the following one:

f(l) =
    min  c^T x
    s.t. A_1 x <= b_1
         (A_2 + l D) x <= b_2

Any bound in this package are in the following form (here for a bound called fct)

fct.ub(problem, lbd_1, lbd_2, *args, **kwargs)
fct.lb(problem, lbd_1, lbd_2, *args, **kwargs)

The bound computes things and then return another function that can be called with the space of l to evaluate.
Typically, the bound is computed between l=lbd_1 and l=lbd_2. If a bound needs a single value of l to work with,
then it uses only lbd_1.
